# LNKS-nnet
Neural network models for predicting membrane potential and firing rate.

## Dependencies
In order to use and train these models, you will first need to install the following dependencies:

Theano: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/#download

Keras: https://github.com/fchollet/keras.git

NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/

SciPy: http://www.scipy.org/

LNKS: https://github.com/baccuslab/LNKS.git

Some models may involve the use of layers not found in Keras. When this is the case, simply install these layers from here: https://github.com/anayebi/keras-extra.git.
