# LNKS-nnet
Neural network models for predicting membrane potential and firing rate.

## Dependencies
In order to use and train these models, you will first need to install the following dependencies:

Theano: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/#download

Keras: https://github.com/fchollet/keras.git

NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/

SciPy: http://www.scipy.org/

LNKS (for loading cell data): https://github.com/baccuslab/LNKS.git

Some of the models may involve the use of layers not found in Keras (noted at the top of the file). If this is the case, simply install these layers from here: https://github.com/anayebi/keras-extra.git.
